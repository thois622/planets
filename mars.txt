Mars
Mars is a planet in space. 
It is also known as the red planet (although there are other red plants in our solar system).

Currently there are initiatives to send humans to mars, with a longer term goal of colonising mars.

There has been a recent surge in interest about mars, and consequently multiple films have been made about it.
